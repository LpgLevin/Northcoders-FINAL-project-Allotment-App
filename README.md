# Allotment

# For Users

## About the this project:
This App was built in a team of 6 in the project phase of the software development bootcamp at Northcoders. It helps users organise and maintain a veg patch. 8-bit vegetables can be added to the user's in-app allotment, giving a harvesting window and task notifications.

## The login or register page is the first screen a user will land on when they open the Allotment app:

## When the user selects register, they will be prompted to choose an avatar and fill out name, email and password fields:

## Once the user has logged in to the app, they have the option to edit their account details:

## The user can change their email, avatar, or password.

## When new users log in to the app for the first time, the allotment will be completely emtpy!

## The user can then use the Navbar on the left, click on 'plants' and got to the plants page:

## The user can click on a single plant to go to the information page for that plant. For example, the carrots page shows a sowing and harvesting calendar for carrots and a button for the user to add it to their allotment...

## ...and sowing instructions for carrots...

## When the user clicks on the add button they will be given a calendar to select a sowing date so that the harvesting window can be personalised for their allotment and put in their todo list:

## Once the user has added a plant, they will be given the option to view their updated allotment:

## Also, the add button will become a remove button for the plant which has just been added:

## Once the user has added their first plants, they will be able to view them in their allotment like so:

## Tasks relating to plants in the user's allotment will be listed below the allotment display on their allotment page. They will also come through as notifications on a user's device, daily, and at a set time. Users can check off tasks they have completed.

## The team wanted to use tamagotchi-style 8-bit vegetables to add a gamefied element to growing vegetables. Each plant has several images at different stages of growth to allow the user to see a visual progression in their allotment as time goes by, although this functionality has not been implemented yet. Here is an example of a full allotment.
